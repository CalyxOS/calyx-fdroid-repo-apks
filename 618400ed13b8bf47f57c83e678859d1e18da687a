      "message": "That doesn\u0027t sound right. We enforce signature spoofing by package name and privapp perm, but not the sig the apk was signed with.\n\n* prebuilts/calyx/microg: APK signed with key in that repo\n* prod builds: APK re-signed with a secret key\n\nBoth work just fine, so there\u0027s no reason this won\u0027t. The issue is likely missing privapp xml - `GmsCore` has it as a dependency, you can just add the same dependencies here (i.e. don\u0027t copy the xmls, just add the names to the makefile, and it should work)",
